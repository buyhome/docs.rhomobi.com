file_name.ext - The path to the file name, ending in the file name and extension.  
media_type - Media type can be specified explicitly, or can be recognized from the file extension. Known file extensions are:  
 * .mp3 – audio/mpeg

## Alert.show_popup( { :message, :title, :icon, :buttons, :callback } )

Bring the application up front and show a popup message.

:message – text displayed in the popup window.  
:title – title of the popup window.  
:icon – path to an image, or :alert for ! icon, :question for ? icon, :info for information icon.

	  :icon => '/public/images/icon.png',
	  :buttons => ["Yes", "No", 
	    {:id => 'cancel', :title => 'Cancel all'}],
	    :callback => url_for(:action => :on_dissmiss_popup) } )
