# Install Rhodes

## Mac OS

If you're running Mac OS, download the latest [RhoStudio for Macintosh](http://rhomobile.com/rhostudio-mac). This contains the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction) and [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction).

Click on the RhoStudioInstaller for Mac download file to open it. You will get a window similar to this:

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhodes-devel/rhostudio-mac-install.png" alt="RhoStudioInstaller Mac" />

Run the install gems script appropriate for you. You can run "Install gems." If you have Ruby Version Manager, you can run "Install gems on rvm." A terminal window will open; wait for the gems install process to complete.

Then drag RhoStudio to the Applications folder.

You can also install Rhodes without RhoStudio by [installing Ruby and the Rhodes gem](/rhodes/install#rhodes-gem-for-linux-and-non-rhostudio). 

## Windows

If you're running Windows, download the latest [RhoStudio for Windows](http://rhomobile.com/rhostudio-windows). This installs the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction) and [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction).

If you are running Windows 64-bit, you need to use 32-bit Java when you run RhoStudio. You can include the 32-bit Java in the PATH, or you can run RhoStudio with a link to 32-bit Java:

	C:\RhoStudio\eclipse\RhoStudio.exe -vm "<32-bit java path>\bin\javaw.exe"

Once the installer has completed, and you have installed the Java Development Kit, you can skip to the [Setup Rhodes section](#setup-rhodes).

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed for RhoStudio. If you are planning to build for Blackberry or Android, make sure you have JDK version 1.6.0_2 or higher installed; the 32-bit Windows version of the JDK is required for Blackberry tools.

### Installing the Java Development Kit

The Sun JDK for Windows or Linux is available [here](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp). For Windows, install the 32-bit version of the JDK; RhoStudio needs the 32-bit version.

For Mac OS 10.6 and earlier, the JDK is already installed. For Mac OS 10.7, Java is not automatically installed. Download the Java for Mac Installer from [Apple support](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421) and install Java.

### Setting the JDK Path

On Windows installs for RhoMobile, go to RhoStudio Preferences (Windows -> Preferences) and set the JDK path in the rhobuild.yml file. On Windows 64-bit installations, you must set this path to the 32-bit version of the JDK, such as `C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.7.0_01/bin`.

On Mac OS, the path to the JDK is automatically set once Java is installed.

For non-RhoStudio installations, set the JDK path on the JAVA_HOME variable in your PATH.

## Rhodes Gem for Linux and non-RhoStudio

For Linux installations, and for Windows or Mac OS installations that are not using RhoStudio, you need to install the Rhodes gem. Download and install:

1. [Ruby v1.8.7](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (On Windows, [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org) is a convenient way to install Ruby.)

2. [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download) (RubyGems offers a .tgz, a .zip, and a .gem download. You want the .zip.) NOTE: Windows doesn't come with the necessary build tools to install gems ('make', for example). There are various ways to get these tools, but the GnuWin32 project at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ provides the tools, and can be conveniently installed via the GetGnuWin32 installer at http://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/.

3. Install the Rhode Gem.

Run this command to install.

	:::term
  	$ [sudo] gem install rhodes

NOTE: If you get any `no such file to load -- something` messages while running the rake tasks or rhodes commands, this can usually be resolved by putting "sudo" in front of the command, as in `sudo gem install something`.

RhoSimulator, which comes with RhoStudio for Mac and Windows, does not work with Linux.

You can [install RhoStudio as a plugin for Eclipse](rhostudio-eclipse) if you are not using RhoStudio for Macintosh or RhoStudio for Windows.

## Setup Rhodes

Once you have Rhodes, you will need the SDKs for the platform you want to build your app on. These instructions are found [here](build).

If you are not using RhoStudio, after you install the gem and your desired SDKs, you need to run:

	:::term
	$ rhodes-setup

This will prompt you for where you installed the SDKs for the various platforms.  The installation script will display its best guess as to where the SDK is. You can then enter a new location, or leave it blank to use the suggestion. If you are not building for a specific platform (for example, you can't build for the iPhone on Windows), you can leave that SDK location blank. You can find prerequisites for each platform [here](build#all-platforms-prerequisites).

If you are using RhoStudio, you can either run rhodes-setup, or you can set the SDK paths in RhoStudio Preferences.
