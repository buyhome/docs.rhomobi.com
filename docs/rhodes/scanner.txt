Applicable scanner types: Laser and Imager

Default: Device specific 

####scanTimeout
Maximum time in milliseconds that laser scanners will emit a beam or imager scanners will enable the imager. A value of 0 indicates an infinite timeout. This parameter is compatibile with aimType:trigger, aimType:timedHold, aimType:timedRelease and aimType:pressAndRelease

Possible Values:milliseconds

Applicable scanner types: Laser and Imager

Default: 5000 

####rasterMode
Describes the type of vertical rastering to use. 

Possible Values:

none:
  No vertical rastering.

openAlways:
  Vertical rastering is always full open.  To adjust the rastering height use the rasterHeight property.

smart:
  Vertical rastering mode is 'Smart'.

cyclone:
  Vertical rastering mode is 'Cyclone'.

Applicable scanner types: Laser Only

Default: Device specific 

####rasterHeight
Vertical rastering height to use, as a percentage, when rasterMode:openAlways is applied.

Possible Values:0 - 100

Applicable scanner types: Laser Only

Default: Device specific 

####aimType
Describes the type of aiming to use. 

Possible values:

trigger:
  Standard trigger mode.  Holding the trigger will start a decoding session.  
  The decoding session ends when a barcode is decoded, scanTimeout occurs or the trigger is released.

timedHold:
  Aiming lasts for the time specified by 'timedAimDuration' before decoding.  
  The decode will last until the barcode is decoded or scanTimeout occurs.

timedRelease:
  Aiming lasts until trigger is released.  
  If the timedAimDuration has expired when the trigger is released then a decode session is started
  until a barcode is decoded or for the remaining time equal to the scanTimeout value.

presentation:
  Only applicable to Kiosk devices, the scanner illuminates when movement is detected 
  in the range of the scanner window.  The scanner must be initiated with a softscan
  using the scanner.start() method.  

pressAndRelease:
  Scan will continue after the trigger is released until scanTimeout occurs.

continuousRead:	
  Once the trigger is pulled barcodes will continue to be scanned whilst the trigger
  is held, enabling rapid scanning, to be used in conjunction with sameSymbolTimeout 
  and differentSymbolTimeout.  This value is ignored if viewfinderMode is set to 
  'dynamicReticle'

Applicable scanner types: Laser and Imager

Default: Device specific 

####timedAimDuration
Duration in milliseconds for aimType:timedHold and aimType:timedRelease

Possible Values:milliseconds

Applicable scanner types: Laser and Imager

Default: Device specific 

####sameSymbolTimeout
When the aimType:continuousRead property is applied this value defines the interval between which the same barcode can be decoded twice. The value is specified in milliseconds, use 0 to indicate no interval between successive reads. Use this value to prevent accidental duplicate scans.

Possible Values:milliseconds

Applicable scanner types: Laser and Imager

Default: 2500 

differentSymbolTimeout:[Value]  When the aimType:continuousRead property is applied this value defines the interval between which different barcodes can be scanned. The value is specified in milliseconds, use 0 to indicate no interval between successive reads. Use this setting to allow time for the operator to reaim the device between successive scans.

Possible Values:milliseconds

Applicable scanner types: Laser and Imager

Default: 500 

####aimMode
Describes the aiming mode to used. 

Possible values:

none:
  No Aiming (Can be overridden by picklistMode).  

dot:
  Laser barcode readers will show a dot for aiming.

slab:
  Laser barcode readers will show a slab for aiming.

reticle:
  Imager barcode readers will show a reticle for aiming

Applicable scanner types: Laser and Imager

Default: Device specific 

####picklistMode
Allows the imager to decode only the barcode that is directly under the cross-hair / center of the reticle. This feature is most useful in applications where multiple barcodes may appear in the field of view during a decode session and only one of them is targeted for decode. When enabled picklistMode will override aimMode if no aiming is chosen and use aimMode:reticle. This mode will also interact with viewfinderMode, see the EMDK for C help file for more information. Enabling picklist mode may adversely affect overall decoding performance. 

Possible values:

disabled:
  Disables picklist mode so any barcode within the field of view can be decoded.

hardwareReticle:
  Enables picklist mode so that only the barcode under the projected reticle can 
  be decoded.  If the imager does not support a projected reticle then the 
  behaviour is the same as softwareReticle.

softwareReticle:
  Enables picklist mode so that only the barcode in the center of the image is 
  decoded.  This is most useful when used in conjunction with static and 
  dynamic reticle viewfinder modes.

Applicable scanner types: Imager Only

Default: Device specific 

####viewfinderMode
Configures the mode of the scanner viewfinder window. This attribute is not supported on all Scanners 
and will interact with the picklistMode parameter, see the EMDK for C help file for more information.

Possible values:

enabled:
  Only the viewfinder is enabled (not the reticle).  Displays a viewfinder on the
  screen showing the image being captured by the camera.

disabled:
  The viewfinder will not be displayed during aiming or scanning.

staticReticle:
  Displays the viewfinder as well as draws a red reticle in the center of the image
  which helps with tracking the barcode.

dynamicReticle:
  Displays the viewfinder as well as draws a red reticle in the center of the image.
  If the barcode in the image is 'decodable' the reticle turns green to indicate
  this.  This mode requires a second trigger press to decode the barcode after the
  reticle turns green.

Applicable scanner types: Imager Only

Default: Device specific
