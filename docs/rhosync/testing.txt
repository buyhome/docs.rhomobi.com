Testing Your RhoSync Application
===
RhoSync provides a [spec](http://rspec.info/) framework for [behavior driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development) of your application.  When your application and source adapters are generated, you will see spec files generated in the top-level 'spec' folder of your application.

## Example Spec

Here is a simple example spec for the [rhostore product adapter](http://github.com/rhomobile/store-server/blob/master/sources/product.rb):

	:::ruby
	it "should process Product query" do
	  test_query.size.should > 0
	  query_errors.should == {}
	end

This simple spec runs the query method of our product adapter and verifies the result is greater than one object and has no errors.

The full code listing for this product_spec is available [on github](http://github.com/rhomobile/store-server/blob/master/spec/sources/product_spec.rb).

## Running Specs
From your application's root folder:
	
	:::term
  	$ rake rhosync:spec
	[11:43:29 AM 2011-01-10] Rhosync Server v2.1.1 started...
	Product
	  should process Product query
	  should process Product create
	  should process Product update
	  should process Product delete

	Finished in 4.353873 seconds

	4 examples, 0 failures
	

This will also automatically generate an rcov report under 'coverage' if you have rcov installed (currently only Mac/Linux support rcov).

## Test API
For the most up-to-date Test API, please see the [rdocs](http://rdoc.info/projects/rhomobile/rhosync).

### `setup_test_for(adapter,user_id)`
Initializes the source adapter under test for a given user, typically in a before(:each) block
	
	:::ruby
	# 'testuser' will be used by rest of the specs
	setup_test_for(Product,'testuser') 

### `test_query`
Executes the adapter's query method and returns the master document (:md) stored in redis.

For example, if your source adapter query method was:
	
	:::ruby
	def query(params=nil)
	  @result = { 
	    "1" => { 
		  "name"=>"Acme", 
	      "industry"=>"Electronics"},
	    "2" => { 
		  "name"=>"Best", 
		  "industry"=>"Software"
	    }
	  }
	end

`test_query` would return:
	
	:::ruby
	{ 
	  "1" => { 
		"name" => "Acme", 
		"industry"=>"Electronics"
	  },
	  "2" => { 
		"name" => "Best", 
		"industry" => "Software"
	  }
	}

### `query_errors`
Returns any errors stored in redis for the previous source adapter query.

For example:  

	:::ruby
	{ 
	  "query-error" => {
		  "message" => "error connecting to web service!"
	  }
	}
	

### `test_create(record)`
Execute's the adapter's create method with a provided record and returns the object string from the create method.  If the create method returns a string, then a link will be saved for the device next time it synchronizes.  This link can be tested here.

For example, in your spec:
	:::ruby
	@product = {
	  'name' => 'iPhone',
	  'brand' => 'Apple',
	  'price' => '$299.99',
	  'quantity' => '5',
	  'sku' => '1234'
	}
	new_product_id = test_create(@product)
	create_errors.should == {}
	md[new_product_id].should == @product
 
### `create_errors`
This will return the result of the adapter's create method.  The master document (:md) should also contain the new record.
Returns any errors stored in redis from the previous source adapter create (same structure as query errors).

### `test_update(record)`
Execute the source adapter's update method.  Takes a record as hash of hashes (object_id => object)

For example:
	
	:::ruby
	test_update({'4' => {'price' => '$199.99'}})
	update_errors.should == {}
	test_query
	md[product_id]['price'].should == '$199.99'
 
This will call the adapter's update method for object_id '4'.

**NOTE: To test the master document, you will need to run `test_query` as shown above.**

### `update_errors`
Returns any errors stored in redis from the previous source adapter update (same structure as query errors).

### `test_delete(record)`
Execute the source adapter's delete method.  Takes a record as hash of hashes (object_id => object).

For example:
	
	:::ruby
	@product = {
	  'name' => 'iPhone',
	  'brand' => 'Apple',
	  'price' => '$299.99',
	  'quantity' => '5',
	  'sku' => '1234'
	}
	test_delete('4' => @product)
	delete_errors.should == {}
	md.should == {}
 
This will call the adapter's delete method for product '4'.

**NOTE: The master document (:md) will be updated and can be verified as shown above.**

### `delete_errors`
Returns any errors stored in redis from the previous source adapter delete (same structure as query errors).

### `md`
Returns the master document (:md) for the source adapter stored in redis.  This is equivalent to the @result hash of hashes structure.

For example:
	
	:::ruby
	md.should == { 
	  "1" => { 
		"name"=>"Acme", 
		"industry"=>"Electronics"
	  },
	  "2" => { 
		"name"=>"Best", 
		"industry"=>"Software"
	  }
	}

### `cd`
Returns the client document (:cd) for the source adapter + client under test.  The master document (:md) and client document (:cd) should be equal after the query is executed.

For example:
	
	:::ruby
	test_query.size.should > 0
	md.should == cd
