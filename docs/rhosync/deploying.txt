Deploying a RhoSync Application
===

Since RhoSync applications are standard ruby [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) applications, you have many hosting options.  This section will cover two ways to deploy a RhoSync application: use the RhoHub service, deploy to an on-premise server.

## Preparing App for Production
By default your RhoSync application generates a few files that you should be familiar with and understand the settings.

### `config.ru`
This rackup file contains runtime configuration for the RhoSync sinatra application:
	
	:::ruby
	Rhosync::Server.disable :run
	Rhosync::Server.disable :clean_trace
	Rhosync::Server.enable  :raise_errors
	Rhosync::Server.set     :secret,      '<changeme>'
	Rhosync::Server.set     :root,        ROOT_PATH
	Rhosync::Server.use     Rack::Static, :urls => ["/data"], :root => Rhosync::Server.root
	
The important setting here `:secret` you will want to change.  `:secret` should be set to a long random string, it ___should not___ be set to a dictionary word or short string (30 characters or more is sufficient).  This is used for the session storage using a digest algorithm as described [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#session-storage).

If you don't change the `:secret` setting, RhoSync automatically warns you each time the application starts:

 	[11:34:56 AM 2011-01-12] ************************************************************

	[11:34:56 AM 2011-01-12] WARNING: Change the session secret in config.ru from <changeme> to something secure.
	[11:34:56 AM 2011-01-12]   i.e. running `rake secret` in a rails app will generate a secret you could use.

	[11:34:56 AM 2011-01-12] ************************************************************
	

As this warning states, a good way to generate a cryptographically secure secret is by running `rake secret` in a new rails application.

	:::term
	$ rails new blogger
	$ cd blogger
	$ rake secret
	040a2355475e9d0fb591ef78d5b9ca61a34cbcfd3f11942b18bc1d91f1ca66c27b2e0386333843a7efa29f40fff03624cd908d0883364ffbfa3208ab23fa2664
	
Then plug this secret into your `config.ru`:

	:::ruby
	Rhosync::Server.set     :secret, '040a2355475e9d0fb591ef78d5b9ca61a34cbcfd3f11942b18bc1d91f1ca66c27b2e0386333843a7efa29f40fff03624cd908d0883364ffbfa3208ab23fa2664'

To run RhoSync in production mode, use `RACK_ENV` environment variable set to "production".  This ensures RhoSync will use the `:production` section of the settings.  For example:

	:::term
	$ thin start -e production -p 9292

Will start thin in with `RACK_ENV` set to "production".  

NOTE: If you deploy using passenger or on RhoHub, this variable is automatically set to production.

### `settings/settings.yml`
This file contains all source adapter options and settings like the redis server connection.  Before deploying to production, make sure you have the appropriate production settings:

	:::yaml
	:sources: 
	  Product: 
	    :poll_interval: 300

	:production: 
	  :redis: myredishost:6379
	  :licensefile: settings/license.key
	  :syncserver: http://localhost:9292/application/

### `settings/license.key`
This contains your RhoSync license key text.  By default, a RhoSync application comes with a 10 device license.  Please see the [licensing page](/rhosync/licensing) for more details.

## Hosting on RhoHub
The [RhoHub](/rhohub/introduction) service offers several [production RhoSync application hosting levels](http://rhohub.com/pricing).  Simply sign up on [rhohub.com](http://rhohub.com/) and go through the [tutorial](/rhohub/tutorial) on deploying your first RhoSync application with RhoHub.

## Deploying On-Premise
The [sinatra book](http://sinatra-book.gittr.com/) has some great [deployment documentation](http://sinatra-book.gittr.com/#deployment) that you should review before running your RhoSync application in production.

We recommend using the [phusion passenger](http://modrails.com/index.html) stack for deploying an on-premise RhoSync application.  Please refer to the [section on rack applications](http://modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#_deploying_a_rack_based_ruby_application) for information on deploying a RhoSync sinatra application.
