RhoSync Generator and Rake Tasks
===

## RhoSync Generator

The `rhosync` utility is a command line tool for generating RhoSync applications and sources.

### Generate an Application

The app name is passed as a parameter.  The `rhosync` utility will generate a directory for your application with all the necessary files to get started.  We will start with running `rhosync app` to see the usage:

	:::term
	Usage: rhosync app [options] [args]

	Generates a new rhosync application.

	Required:
	  name        - application name


	Options specific for this generator:

	General options:
	    -p, --pretend                    Run, but do not make any changes.
	    -f, --force                      Overwrite files that already exist.
	    -s, --skip                       Skip files that already exist.
	    -d, --delete                     Delete files that have previously been generated with this generator.
	        --no-color                   Don't colorize the output
	    -h, --help                       Show this message
	        --debug                      Do not catch errors

For example:

	:::term
	$ rhosync app storeserver
	Generating with app generator:
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/config.ru
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/settings/settings.yml
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/settings/license.key
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/application.rb
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/Rakefile
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/spec/spec_helper.rb
	
Here's a basic rundown of each of the files that were just generated:
	
	
* **config.ru** - This is a rackup file which will load your application.  RhoSync uses the excellent [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web framework to run the application.
* **settings/settings.yml** - This contains settings such as your redis connection, which source adapters exist and their parameters.  You can also put custom settings here.
* **settings/license.key** - The RhoSync license associated with your application.  The default license allows up to 10 devices to synchronize with the application.
* **application.rb** - The RhoSync application class where you can implement authentication.  You can also add other custom methods here to use in your application.  This class is a singleton, so all methods should be added to the `class << self` block.
* **Rakefile** - This contains tasks that can be run from the terminal.
* **spec/spec_helper.rb** - A helper file which loads the environment for running specs.

### Add a New Source Adapter

To generate a source for your RhoSync application, run the `rhosync source` command:

	:::term
	Usage: rhosync source [options] [args]

	Generates a new source adapter.

	Required:
	  name        - source name(i.e. product)


	Options specific for this generator:

	General options:
	    -p, --pretend                    Run, but do not make any changes.
	    -f, --force                      Overwrite files that already exist.
	    -s, --skip                       Skip files that already exist.
	    -d, --delete                     Delete files that have previously been generated with this generator.
	        --no-color                   Don't colorize the output
	    -h, --help                       Show this message
	        --debug                      Do not catch errors
	
For example:

	:::term
	$ cd storeserver
	$ rhosync source product
	Generating with source generator:
	     [ADDED]  sources/product.rb
	     [ADDED]  spec/sources/product_spec.rb
	
This generates a source adapter file `product.rb` and corresponding [rspec](http://rspec.info/) file `product_spec.rb`.  If you choose, you can use this spec to implement the source adapter.

## Rake Tasks

Each RhoSync application uses [rake](https://github.com/jimweirich/rake) to manage development tasks such as starting/stopping the app, starting resque workers, and running specs.

To run a RhoSync rake task, simply type `rake the-task-to-run` in your RhoSync application's root directory.

### Installing DTach (Mac OS / Linux only)

If you're using MacOS / Linux, install [dtach](http://dtach.sourceforge.net/) on your path before running any of the rake tasks.  [DTach](http://dtach.sourceforge.net/) is a simple utility which runs processes in a detached state so you can re-attach your console later.

	:::term
	$ cd storeserver
 	$ rake dtach:install

### Setup Redis

Next, you will need to setup and start a [redis](http://redis.io/) server:

	:::term
	$ rake redis:install
	$ rake redis:start
	
### Start the Application

Now, start the application!

	:::term
	$ rake rhosync:start
	
If everything went well, you should see the following in your console:

	[02:37:03 PM 2011-01-06] Rhosync Server v2.1.1 started...
	
To open the web console, navigate to [http://localhost:9292/](http://localhost:9292) in your browser or run:

	:::term
	$ rake rhosync:web
	
### Common Tasks

RhoSync applications come with many useful rake tasks for administrative and development workflows.  Some common ones are:

* 	`rake dtach:install` - (Mac OS / Linux only) This will install [dtach](http://dtach.sourceforge.net/) to /usr/local/bin.

* 	`rake redis:install` - This will install to the system.  On Mac OS / Linux, it will attempt to install in '/usr/local/bin' (on windows, C:\redis-<version>), unless you have specified a REDIS_HOME to use instead.
	
* 	`rake rhosync:set_admin_password` - Set the RhoSync administrator password.  The default password is blank ''.

*	`rake rhosync:get_token` - Get a RhoSync API token to use for calling the RhoSync REST API.
		
**NOTE: On Mac OS / Linux, you need to install dtach (i.e. by running `rake dtach:install`) to run the following tasks: **

* 	`rake redis:start` - This will launch a redis server in a new console.
	
* 	`rake redis:stop` - Stop the currently-running redis server.

*	`rake redis:attach` - (Mac OS / Linux only) Attach to a currently-running redis server.

* 	`rake rhosync:start` - Start the RhoSync application in a new console.  This requires a running redis server.

* 	`rake rhosync:stop` - Stop the currently-running RhoSync application.
	
*	`rake rhosync:attach` - (Mac OS / Linux only) Attach to a currently-running RhoSync application. 

* 	`rake rhosync:clean_start` - Useful for development, resets and bootstraps the RhoSync application with a test user.

Some other useful development tasks:

*	`rake rhosync:reset` - Reset the RhoSync application to the initial state.  This WILL DELETE ALL DATA IN REDIS! So be sure you don't run this in production!

*	`rake rhosync:spec` - Run all source adapter specs in spec/sources/.
	
*	`rake rhosync:web` - Open the RhoSync web console in a browser.

Here is a complete list of the rake tasks available in a RhoSync application:

	:::term
	$ cd storeserver
	$ rake -T
	(in ~/storeserver)
