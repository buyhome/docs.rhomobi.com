# Installing RhoConnect

On Windows and Mac OS, the usual way to install RhoConnect is to install RhoStudio. 

On Linux, you install the Rhodes gem from the command line; you can also do this from Windows or Mac OS.

## Mac OS

If you're running Mac OS, download the latest [RhoStudio Installer for Macintosh](http://rhomobile.com/rhostudio-mac). This contains the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction) and [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction).

Click on the RhoStudioInstaller for Mac download file to open it. You will get a window similar to this:

Run the install gems script appropriate for you. You can run "Install gems." If you have Ruby Version Manager, you can run "Install gems on rvm." A terminal window will open; wait for the gems install process to complete.

Then drag RhoStudio to the Applications folder.

You can also install RhoConnect without RhoStudio by [installing Ruby and the RhoConnect gem](/rhoconnect/install#rhoconnect-gem-for-linux-and-non-rhostudio). 

## Windows

If you're running Windows 32-bit, download the latest [RhoStudio Installer for Windows](http://rhomobile.com/rhostudio-windows). This installs the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction), and [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction).

If you are running Windows 64-bit, you need to use 32-bit Java when you run RhoStudio. You can include the 32-bit Java in the PATH, or you can run RhoStudio with a link to 32-bit Java:

	C:\RhoStudio\eclipse\RhoStudio.exe -vm "<32-bit java path>\bin\javaw.exe"

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed for RhoStudio. If you are planning to build for Blackberry or Android, make sure you have JDK version 1.6.0_2 or higher installed; the 32-bit Windows version of the JDK is required for Blackberry tools.

### Installing the Java Development Kit

The Sun JDK for Windows or Linux is available [here](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp). For Windows, install the 32-bit version of the JDK; RhoStudio needs the 32-bit version.

For Mac OS 10.6 and earlier, the JDK is already installed. For Mac OS 10.7, Java is not automatically installed. Download the Java for Mac Installer from [Apple support](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421) and install Java.

### Setting the JDK Path

On Windows installs for RhoMobile, go to RhoStudio Preferences (Windows -> Preferences) and set the JDK path in the rhobuild.yml file. On Windows 64-bit installations, you must set this path to the 32-bit version of the JDK, such as `C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.7.0_01/bin`.

On Mac OS, the path to the JDK is automatically set once Java is installed.

For non-RhoStudio installations, set the JDK path on the JAVA_HOME variable in your PATH.

## Rhoconnect Gem for Linux and non-RhoStudio

For Linux installations, and for Windows or Mac OS installations that are not using RhoStudio, you need to install the RhoConnect gem. Download and install:

1. [Ruby v1.8.7](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (On Windows, [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org) is a convenient way to install Ruby.)

2. [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download) (RubyGems offers a .tgz, a .zip, and a .gem download. You want the .zip.) NOTE: Windows doesn't come with the necessary build tools to install gems ('make', for example). There are various ways to get these tools, but the GnuWin32 project at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ provides the tools, and can be conveniently installed via the GetGnuWin32 installer at http://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/.

3. Ruby Web Server - We tested with [thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/), and [passenger](http://www.modrails.com/). WEBrick, the web server that ships with ruby, is known to cause issues with HTTP headers/cookies and is ***not*** recommended.

4. [Redis](http://redis.io/) - RhoConnect includes a simple [rake task](/rhoconnect/command-line#rake-tasks) `redis:install` to install redis, covered in the [Rake Tasks section](rhoconnect/command-line#rake-tasks). Alternatively, you can [install redis directly](http://redis.io/download).

5. Install the RhoConnect Gem.

Run this command to install.

	:::term
	$ [sudo] gem install rhoconnect

NOTE: If you get any `no such file to load -- something` messages while running the rake tasks or rhodes commands, this can usually be resolved by putting "sudo" in front of the command, as in `sudo gem install something`.

RhoSimulator, which comes with RhoStudio for Mac and Windows, does not work with Linux.
