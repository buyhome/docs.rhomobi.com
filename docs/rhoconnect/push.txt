Push Synchronization
===

Use push synchronization when you want to automatically detect changes on the RhoConnect side, and you want to push those changes to your client without having to tell your client to sync.

RhoConnect has a simple ruby API for sending push notifications (a ping call) to a user's devices. This API can be called directly, queued as a resque job, or called remotely via the [RhoConnect REST API](/rhoconnect/rest-api). The push message can trigger the following actions in the rhodes application: alert with a message, sync one or more sources, vibrate, display a badge, and play a sound file.

The following sections show how to use the RhoConnect application to deliver push messages on each platform and how you can handle the push notification in your Rhodes application.

You will need to perform the following tasks.

* [Set up the configuration settings in the RhoConnect application](/rhoconnect/push-server-setup) for your mobile client operating system.
* [Execute a ping call](/rhoconnect/push-backend-setup) from your RhoConnect source adapter or from your backend application that uses a RhoConnect plugin.
* [Set up push notification support](/rhoconnect/push-client-setup) -- receiving push notifications from the RhoConnect server/backend -- on your Android, Blackberry, or iPhone client application.
