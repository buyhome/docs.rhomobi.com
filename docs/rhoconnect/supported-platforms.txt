## Known Issues

* Windows platform: only pre-release (~> 1.0.0.beta) of <b>eventmachine</b> is working on Windows  
* Examples for <b>RSpec</b> (~> 2.8.0) fail for Ruby 1.8.7, gemset locked to ver. >= 2.6.0. <b>Issue is fixed in v. 3.1.2.</b>
* Rack is locked to version 1.3.6 due to issues with RhoConnect applications deployed on Heroku (502 server error if rhoconnect bundled with rake 1.4.1). <b>Fixed in v. 3.1.2.</b>
* If you deploy your RhoConnect application deploy on <b>Heroku</b>, then use new [Cedar](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar) stack. The Bamboo stack is older than the widespread adoption of bundler, 
so on Bamboo your application is not invoked in the context of your bundle and might not works properly.
