RhoConnect settings
===

All Rhoconnect application and source settings located in the *`settings/settings.yml`* file.
There are two main categories: application environment settings and source settings.

## Application settings

Application-wide settings are specified per deployment environment (`:test`, `:development`, `:production`).
Each of the environment categories must have the following entries:
	
	:::yaml
	:syncserver: <url> - application's base url
	:redis: <url> - Redis url
	:licensefile: <filename> - application's license file
	
In addition, the following settings can be specified:

	:::yaml
	:poll_interval_default: <secs> - default sync poll interval setting for source adapters.
									 This setting is used as a default if source doesn't specify
									 its own value. Also, it is applied to dynamic adapters
									 as a default sync poll interval.
	:bulk_sync_poll_interval: <secs> - poll interval setting for bulk data sync
	
	:c2dm_username: <google's email>
	:c2dm_passwd: <passwd>                       
	:authtoken: <authtoken>          - these settings are used specifically for Android push notifications.
									   In order to push messages to the Android device, your server needs to 
									   obtain Google's C2DM authentication token associated with the trusted google account.
									   For this purpose, you can specify C2DM Google account's username/password combo 
									   via the `:c2dm_username` and `:c2dm_passwd` settings.
									   At run-time, the system will use these credentials to obtain 
									   the C2DM token and store it in the Redis for the future use.
									   Once the token is expired, the system will automatically 
									   connect to the Google C2DM service to renew the token.

									   Alternatively, you can use `:authtoken` setting to specify 
									   the pre-defined authentication token. This token MUST be related to the role-based google account 
									   registered for your application. See [the rhodes push instructions](/rhodes/device-caps#push-notifications) 
									   for more details. To retrieve this token, use sample script [c2dm.rb](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes/blob/master/bin/c2dm.rb). 
									   Uncomment last two lines and put your google account specific data, then run it. 
									   It will print token to stdout.
									   This approach, however, will not allow the server to connect 
									   to the C2DM service and renew the token once it is expired.

## Source settings

All source-specific settings are specified under the corresponding source name entry in the `:sources` category.
Typical source settings include:

	:::yaml
	:poll_interval: <secs> - source's sync poll interval.
	:force_default: <true|false> - if specified, this setting forces to use 
									 default application poll interval
								     even if source has its own setting.
    :partition_type: <app|user> - default partition type for the source
