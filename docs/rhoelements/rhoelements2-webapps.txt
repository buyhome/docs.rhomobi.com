# RhoElements-Enabling Your Web App

If you have an existing application that is running from a web server, it is very easy to extend this application and provide RhoElements functionality. Beyond the standard HTML5 features that may be utilized, RhoElements provides a very easy way for you to add device capabilities to your web application through Javascript for HTML Meta tags. Let's say for example you have a form on one of your pages and you want to enable bar code scanning for ease of data entry. This can be accomplished by adding a few lines of Javascript to your pages. You do not need to build and compile of RhoElements application using RhoStudio. You simply need to install a RhoElements runtime application on the device and configure it to point to your web server.

## Installing the RhoElements Runtime

After [Installing RhoMobile Suite](/rhoelements/rhoelements-install), there will be a set of executables (runtimes) for Windows Mobile, Windows CE and Android found in subfolder of where you installed RhoMobile Suite. You will need to install these executables on each device that will be used for your application. In order for RhoElements to start with your web app, you need to configure it so that it knows which URL to start with. This can be accomplished in multiple ways:

1. Creating a shortcut that changes the default URL that is loaded
2. Modifying the &lt;StartPage&gt; parameter in the default config.xml file


## Configuration Parameters

It is recommended that you get familiar with the [Configuration Parameters](/rhoelements/ConfigurationSettings) both for developing/debugging as well as deployment. 

If you wish to keep all default parameters and just change the starting url, then it is recommended that you simply create a shortcut as described below. 

If you wish to modify other parameters in the config.xml then you should replace the config.xml file after the RhoElements Runtime is installed. Locate the file from the instructions below, copy it to your desktop for modification and then you can use this file along with your distribution of the RhoElements Runtime. This file will need to be overwritten after the installation of the runtime.

The location of the configuration file loaded by RhoElements is dependent on a number of factors:
<ul>
<li/>When running on the Enterprise Tablet the configuration file is read from /Android/data/com.motorolasolutions.rhoelements/Config.xml.
<li/>When running on all other devices RhoElements will attempt to launch the configuration file 'Config.xml' located in the folder 'Config' off the installation root.
</ul>

## Creating Shortcuts on Windows Mobile/CE

You can setup Windows Mobile shortcut files to launch the RhoElements runtime with different startup options that will override the default settings. You set these parameters in a shortcut (.lnk) file for Windows Mobile/CE; you must create this file. You can use a text editor such as Notepad on Windows CE, or use the File menu in Platform Builder (New Project or File, Text File type). Edit the file for command line parameters and save it to \Windows\Start Menu. This will put the shortcut at the top level in your Start Menu.

The RhoElements runtime installation path on Windows CE/Mobile devices is `\Program Files\RhoElements` and the path to the executable is `\Program Files\RhoElements\RhoElements.exe`.

The following command line parameters are supported:

    /C: Specifies the location of the configuration file for the
        RhoElements v1.0 application. This will override all default
		configuration settings.
        e.g. /C:file://\application\config.xml
        
    /S: Specifies the start page of the RhoElements v1.0 application,
	    Other configuration parameters will be used from the default
		config.xml file
        e.g. /S:file://\HTML\index.html
        e.g. /S:http://www.motorola.com

If neither the `/S` nor `/C` parameters are present, then the default values will be used. 

The format in the .lnk file is:

	<line-length>#"<runtime-exe>" <command-line-parameter>"<app-folder>"

For example, will just change the startup page to be a local HTML file:

	89#"\Program Files\Rhoelements\rhoelements.exe" /S:file://\Demos\AttendeeTracker\index.html

## Creating Shortcuts on Android Enterprise Tablet

The Motorola Solutions Enterprise Tablet (ET1) has been customized so that android shortcuts can be created very easily. Once RhoElements is installed on the ET1:

1. Navigate the ET1 to the home page, by pressing the Home button on the device
2. Press and hold until you see the 'Add to Home screen' popup menu display.
3. Select 'Shortcuts'
4. Scroll down and select 'RhoElements'
5. Enter change the 'config.xml path' or enter a 'Application Url'
6. Enter a 'Shortcut name' and then press 'Ok'

The shortcut will be placed on the ET1 home screen. At this time there is no way to provision an ET1 with this shortcut file, as you can with Windows Mobile.
<!-- PLACEHOLDER SCREEN SHOTS NEEDED -->

## Running Multiple Applications

If you have multiple web apps that you would like to point RhoElements Runtime to, you would create multiple shortcuts as described above. 

NOTE: The last application will launch using the same runtime container. Only one application will be running at a time. When launching the second application the runtime simply changes the starting URL **

	
## Customizing the RhoElements Runtime
The RhoElements runtime is a prebuilt Rhodes application that simply launches in full screen mode and loads configuration parameters as described above. If you would like to modify the behavior of the RhoElements runtime, for example change the startup screen or icon, load the Rhodes project into RhoStudio from the following location: 
	<RhoStudio>\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\rhoelements-2.0.0\RhoElements2

To build the Shared Runtime Application, perform the following steps.

On the command line on your Windows PC, navigate to this folder.

	<RhoStudio>\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\rhoelements-2.0.0\RhoElements2

To build for Windows Mobile or Windows CE, run this command.

        rake device:wm:production

The resulting `cab` file can be found at `<RhoStudio>\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\rhoelements-2.0.0\RhoElements2\bin\target\<platform_id>\RhoElements2.cab`.

To build for Android, run this command.

        rake device:android:production

The resulting `apk` file can be found at `<RhoStudio>\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\rhoelements-2.0.0\RhoElements2\bin\target\RhoElements2.apk`

### Deploying The Customized Runtime 

To install your customized Runtime application on your specific device, go to the [build instructions](/rhodes/build) for your platform and use the instructions to deploy an application on your device.

NOTE: The runtime application <b>must</b> be installed to the primary disk partition on the Windows CE/Mobile device, i.e. it has to be installed to `\Program Files\RhoElements2` only.
On Windows Mobile, the `Device` option must be selected when the installer asks for the location to install.
On Windows CE, the default path (`\Program Files\RhoElements`) must be selected.

## Logging a RhoElements WebApp Application

The RhoElements WebApp (hybrid) application log file is configured at [Config.xml](/rhoelements/ConfigurationSettings).

The location of the log file of a RhoElements WebApp (hybrid) application is defined by the following rules (in the order of priority):

1. If the `Value` attribute of `Configuration` > `Logger` > `LogProtocol` tag in the configuration file equals "FILE" or "HTTP", then the path to the log file is taken from the `Configuration` > `Logger` > `LogURI` tag.

    - In case of "FILE" protocol, the file name part of `Value` attribute of `LogURI` tag is ignored and `rholog.txt` is used as a file name.
    - In case of "HTTP" protocol, log messages are sent to the host and the port specified with the `value` attribute of `LogURI` and `LogPort` tags via POST HTTP-requests.

2. If the start page parameter is a local file, then this file folder is used to store the log file.
The file name part of the start page parameter is ignored and `rholog.txt` is used as the file name.
This rule is not applied to Android.

3. Otherwise the log file has name `rholog.txt` and placed at next location:
* Windows Mobile/CE: `rho` folder of the Runtime installation folder.
* Android: `rhodata` folder of the Runtime installation folder (accessible at emulator or rooted device only).
